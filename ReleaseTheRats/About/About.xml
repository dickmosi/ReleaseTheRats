  <description>For far too long have these rodents have remained victims to so-called "balanced game design", BUT NO LONGER! Restore the rats to their rightful glory. Dismantle this oppressive game design, raid by raid! Saw the empire of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of pesky raiders! Randy Random would be so proud!

Oh, right! This mod increases the Rat's "trainable intelligence" from Simple to Intermediate, allowing them to be trained to guard their master and attack enemies.

# Release The Rats [RW 1.1]

# INSTALLATION:
Place "ReleaseTheRats" folder into your RimWorld mods folder.

This mod increases the Rat's "trainable intelligence" from Simple to Intermediate, allowing them to be trained to guard their master and attack enemies.

"For far too long have these rodents have remained victims to so-called "balanced game design", BUT NO LONGER! Restore the rats to their rightful glory. Dismantle this oppressive game design, raid by raid! Saw the empire of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of pesky raiders! Randy Random would be so proud!"


# Things this mod does do
- Increases the Rat's trainable intelligence from Simple to Intermediate (Allowing them to guard their master and attack enemies.)

# Things this mod doesn't do
- Decrease the Rat's Wildness
- Increase the Rat's health or damage (Making them OP)
- Adhere to good game balance

# A noteworthy observation to any would-be crazy rat colonies

Rats have a minimum comfortable temperature of -30°C [-22°F] meaning a corpse freezer would not only be a great home for them but a great way to dispose of bodies from all the raiders they kill!
